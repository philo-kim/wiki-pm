## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Outcome over Features** - Focus on problems, not solutions
2. **Flexible Dates** - Use ranges, not fixed dates
3. **Regular Updates** - Monthly review and adjustment
4. **Clear Priorities** - What we won't do is as important
5. **Visual Clarity** - Simple, scannable, shareable

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

- Over-promising on dates
- Too much detail too early
- Ignoring dependencies
- Not updating regularly
- Feature factory mindset
